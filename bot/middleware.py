"""Activity tracking.

The keeper wants to know *everything* a soul does in the corridor — not only
when a finished message is carried through, but every command typed and every
button tapped, the moment it happens.

This is an aiogram outer middleware attached to both the message and
callback-query observers. For each incoming event it sends the keeper a short,
clean notice of who did what and when, then lets the normal handler run.

It deliberately stays quiet for:
  * the keeper's own actions (you don't need to be told what you just did);
  * plain (non-command) messages — those already produce a full delivery
    notice once the sender chooses what the message carries, so announcing
    them here too would only double up.
